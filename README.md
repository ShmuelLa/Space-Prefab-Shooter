# Space-Prefab-Shooter
This is the surprise game shooter!
Survive by shooting as many enemies as you can, you can shoot once every second so make good use of your shots!
Beware of diagonal enemies because they cannot hurt you but they can confuse and use up your shots!

Changelog from the instructors code:
> Added a timer serialized model for the LaserShooter component the user can choose a fixed amount of seconds that player will have to wait before shooting
> Added diagonally spawning prefab "Enemies" in order to confuse the player. these enemies cannot harm the player but they can confuse him and make him run or shoot them which will waste his ammunition which is now time limited.
> Added background music
> Added mouse directional pointing for the player by using camera and mouse direction. added via MouseMover.cs
